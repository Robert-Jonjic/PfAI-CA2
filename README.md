# Glass Data Analysis and Classification using Neural Networks

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the analysis, preparation, and classification of glass types using a Dense Neural Network (DNN). The project involves:

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing (EDA)**
- **Model Development**
- **Model Evaluation**
- **Conclusion**

- Tools and libraries used: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Key Features of the Project

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing (EDA)
- Performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Visualized feature distributions and correlations to guide preprocessing.
- Cleaned and prepared the data for neural network input.

### 2. Model Development
- Designed a Dense Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Implemented techniques to prevent overfitting (e.g., dropout, early stopping).

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Generated visualizations, including confusion matrices and classification reports.
- Analyzed the modelâ€™s predictions to understand its strengths and weaknesses.
